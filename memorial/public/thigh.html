                        <h3>Squats</h3>
                        <p>Squats primarily target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, making them a highly effective compound exercise for lower body strength and development. When performing squats, the quadriceps, located on the front of the thigh, are heavily engaged during the lowering phase as they work to extend the knee joint. Simultaneously, the hamstrings, situated at the back of the thigh, and the glutes, comprising the buttocks, are activated to stabilize the movement and facilitate hip extension as you rise from the squat position. Additionally, squats engage the core muscles to maintain proper posture and spinal alignment throughout the exercise, further enhancing their effectiveness as a full-body workout.</p>

                        <h3>Lunges</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lunges primarily target the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, making them a versatile lower body exercise that enhances strength, stability, and balance. As you perform lunges, the quadriceps, located on the front of the thigh, engage to extend the knee joint, while the hamstrings, situated at the back of the thigh, assist in controlling the descent and stabilizing the movement. The glutes, comprising the buttocks, are activated to provide stability and power during both the lowering and rising phases of the lunge. </p>

                        <h3>Side Laying Leg Lift</h3>
                        <p>
                            Side lying leg lifts primarily target the gluteus medius and minimus, which are muscles located on the side of the hip. As you perform this exercise, lying on your side with legs stacked and extended, the gluteus medius and minimus engage to lift the top leg upward against gravity. This movement not only strengthens these muscles but also enhances hip abduction, which is the movement of the leg away from the midline of the body. </p>

                        <h3>Fire Hydrant</h3>
                        <p>The fire hydrant exercise primarily targets the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus, which are muscles located on the side of the hip. In this exercise, you start on all fours with your knees directly beneath your hips and your hands directly beneath your shoulders. As you lift one leg out to the side, keeping the knee bent at a 90-degree angle, the gluteus medius and minimus engage to perform hip abduction against gravity. </p>
